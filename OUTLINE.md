# Minecraft-Discord Verification Plugin Specification

## Overview
A plugin that integrates a Minecraft server with Discord by implementing a verification system, allowing players to link their Minecraft and Discord accounts through a simple verification process.

## Core Features

### 1. Discord Bot Integration
- Launch and maintain a Discord bot instance as part of the plugin
- Handle Discord-side verification commands and responses
- Manage role assignments automatically

### 2. Minecraft Commands
- `/verify` - Generate a unique verification code for the player
- `/unlink` - Remove the association between Minecraft and Discord accounts (optional)

## Verification Process Flow

### 1. Initial Server Join
- Player joins the Minecraft server
- No automatic messages or notifications
- Verification remains optional and non-intrusive

### 2. Verification Initiation
- Player types `/verify` in Minecraft
- System generates unique verification code (e.g., AB1234)
- Player receives instructions:
  ```
  To verify your account, send this code to our Discord bot.
  Example: /verify AB1234 on Discord
  ```

### 3. Discord Verification
- Player sends verification code to Discord bot
- Bot validates the code
- On success:
  - Links Minecraft and Discord accounts
  - Assigns configured Discord role(s)
  - Confirms: "Your accounts are now linked! You've been assigned the Verified Player role."
- On failure:
  - Responds: "Invalid or expired code. Please generate a new code by typing /verify on the Minecraft server."

### 4. Account Management

- Optional unlinking feature available through `/unlink` command
- Automatic role removal upon unlinking
