# DiscordLink Configuration
# 
# Discord Bot Setup Instructions:
# 1. Create a new application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
# 2. Add a bot to your application
# 3. Enable the following Privileged Gateway Intents:
#    - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
# 4. Copy your bot token and paste it below
# 5. Create an invite link with these permissions:
#    - Manage Roles
#    - Send Messages
#    - Read Messages/View Channels
#    - Use Slash Commands
# 6. Add these OAuth2 scopes:
#    - bot
#    - applications.commands
# 7. Invite the bot to your server
# 8. IMPORTANT: Make sure the bot's role is positioned ABOVE the verified role in server settings
#    - Go to Server Settings > Roles
#    - Drag the bot's role (usually named after your bot) to be ABOVE the verified role
#    - This is REQUIRED for the bot to assign roles properly
#    - If this is not done, verification will fail with a role hierarchy error

# Plugin Settings
settings:
  # Plugin prefix in messages
  prefix: "&8[&b&lDiscordLink&8]&r "
  # Debug mode - shows extra information in console
  debug: false

# Discord Bot Settings
discord:
  # Your Discord bot token (Required)
  # Get this from https://discord.com/developers/applications
  token: ""

  # Your Discord server/guild ID (Required)
  # Enable Developer Mode in Discord Settings > App Settings > Advanced
  # Right-click your server and click "Copy ID"
  guild_id: ""

  # The role ID to give to verified users (Required)
  # Right-click the role in Server Settings > Roles and click "Copy ID"
  # IMPORTANT: The bot's role MUST be higher in the role list than this role,
  # otherwise it cannot assign the role to users and verification will fail
  verified_role_id: ""

  # Nickname synchronization settings
  # Whether to update Discord nicknames to match Minecraft usernames
  sync_nickname: true
  # Format for nicknames. Use %player% for the Minecraft username
  nickname_format: "%player%"
  # Note: Due to Discord limitations, the server owner's nickname cannot be changed
  # by the bot under any circumstances, even with proper permissions and role hierarchy.
  # Server owners will need to manually set their nickname if desired.

  # Role Hierarchy Note:
  # Discord uses a top-down hierarchy for roles. Roles higher in the list
  # can manage roles below them. For the bot to assign the verified role,
  # the bot's role must be positioned above the verified role in the server's
  # role settings. If verification is failing, check this first!
